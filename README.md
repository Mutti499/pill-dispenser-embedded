## Physical Design & Sanitation Features

- **Individual Compartmentalized Boxes**: Medications are stored in separate, small containers rather than loose pills, preventing cross-contamination
- **Easy-Load Design**: Removable pill boxes can be filled and organized by caregivers or pharmacists in advance
- **Rotation Mechanism**: Internal carousel system precisely aligns and dispenses the correct pill box at scheduled times
- **Sterile Materials**: Pill containers made from medical-grade, non-porous materials that resist bacterial growth
- **Cleanable Surfaces**: All contact surfaces designed with smooth, easily cleanable finishes
- **Hygienic Dispensing**: Touchless delivery system minimizes contamination risks during medication retrieval
- **Sealed Storage**: Internal storage area protects medications from environmental exposure and contaminants
- **Compact Design**: Each compartment optimized for storage efficiency while accommodating various pill sizes
- **Adjustable Audio-Visual Alerts**: System uses buzzer and LED to notify patients when medication is dispensed, with customizable beep intervals controlled via potentiometer (0.5-5 seconds)
- **Ergonomic Retrieval**: Easy-access dispensing area designed for users with limited dexterity
- **Compliance Tracking**: System records when pill boxes are removed, creating an adherence history
- **Bluetooth-Based Logging**: Medication dispensing and retrieval events transmitted via Bluetooth to local control system, with architecture designed for easy integration with remote monitoring solutions
- **Real-Time Status Dashboard**: Web interface displays current medication schedule and adherence history

This project demonstrates embedded systems integration, real-time programming, sensor integration, and human-centered design for healthcare applications.
